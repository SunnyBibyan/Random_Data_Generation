# Random Data Generation

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to generate and analyze random datasets using various statistical distributions. The generated data can be used for data analysis, machine learning experiments, and statistical modeling. The application is built using Streamlit, a Python library for creating interactive web applications.

## Features

- **Data Generation**: Create datasets with 5000 rows using:
  - Normal (Gaussian) distribution for continuous data.
  - Uniform distribution for values within a specified range.
  - Exponential distribution for modeling time between events.
  - Random integers for categorical or discrete values.
  - Binomial distribution for binary outcomes.
  
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Compute and display basic statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation for the generated data.

- **Data Visualization**: Visualize the data using histograms to observe the distribution patterns of different columns.

- **Data Export**: Export the generated dataset to a CSV file for further analysis.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SunnyBibyan/Random_Data_Generation.git
